    "Load longdata.RData from bCourses. You may use Odat.long or Odat.wide for your analysis. They are identical except for the format. The columns are labeled according to how we normally notate them. A1's are the binary treatments, A2's are the censoring indicators, Y's are the binary survival outcomes and L's  are the covariates, which are either continuous or binary as you will see upon looking at the dataframe. Fortunately, the data is already cleaned, as in, NA's are produced for all nodes after outcome is 1 (death) and also after censoring occurs.  \n",

    "Assuming sequential randomization and positivity as usual, estimate the difference in counterfactual mean outcomes at time 5 under treatment and not: $\\mathbb{E}[Y(5)_{\\bar{a}=(0,0,1,1,1)}]-\\mathbb{E}[Y(5)_{\\bar{a}=(0,0,0,0,0)}]$. Give estimates using IPTW and TMLE (debiasing eachh outcome regression with a targeting step, moving backward in time and otherwise known as L-TMLE) and show all code used to do so.  Your superlearner library should include three algorithms, one of each of the following: glm, mean, xgboost. Provide instructions on how I may access your superlearner results in this estimation process."
