### Problem 1
Show the CAR condition, $x \rightarrow Pr(O = o | X = x)$ for $x \in \mathcal{C}(o)$ is constant implies $Pr(X=x| O = o) = Pr(X = x | x \in \mathcal{C}(o))$. You may assume all random variables here are discrete for simplicity.

\vspace{.1in}
Intuitively, the CAR assumption says that the observation of $O=o$ is not influenced by the specific value of $X$ in $\mathcal{C}(O)$ which was taken, only by the fact that $X$ did take a value in $\mathcal{C}(O)$. Thus, the CAR condition is equivalent to 

$$Pr(O = o | X = x) = Pr(O=o | X \in C(O)) \text{ for all }o, x\in\mathcal{C}(o)$$
which can be rewritten as, 

$$Pr(O = o | X = x \text{ and } X \in C(O)) = Pr(O=o | X \in C(O)) \text{ for all } x\in\mathcal{C}(o)\text{ .}$$

clearly identifying the conditional independence assumption: given $X\in\mathcal{C}(O)$, the events $X=x$ and $O=o$ are conditionally independent. By symmetry of conditional independence we have, 

$$Pr(X=x|O=o \text{ and } X \in \mathcal{C}(O)) = Pr(X=x|X\in\mathcal{C}(O))\text{ .}$$

But, since the former is equal to $Pr(X=x|O=o)$, we have that CAR is equivalent to 

$$ Pr(X=x|O=o) = Pr(X=x|X\in\mathcal{C}(O)) \text{ for all } x\in\mathcal{C}(o)\text{ .}$$

So we see that this conditional probability of the full data, $X$, given $O$ is only dependent the distribution of $P_X$
Thus the observation of $O=o$ tells us no more, in the sense of what is now the conditional distribution of $X$, than the obvious $X\in\mathcal{C}(O)$

### Problem 2 
Let $P_{X,\epsilon}$ be a path through $P_X$, the distribution of the full data, $X$, and having score $S_1(X)$. This then defines a path $P_{P_{X,\epsilon},G}$ through the observed data distribution, $P_{P_XG}$. Show that the scores generated by these paths are $E[S_1(X) | O = o]$.

\vspace{.1in}

$$\frac{d}{d\epsilon}logdP_{P_{X,\epsilon}G}/dP_{P_{X}G}|_{\epsilon=0} = \frac{d}{d\epsilon}logdP_{P_{X,\epsilon}G}|_{\epsilon=0}$$

$$ = \int\frac{dP(O=o|X=x)S_1(x)dP(x)d\nu(x)}{dP_{P_{X}G}(o)}$$

$$ = \int S_1(x)dP(x|O=o)d\nu(x)$$

$$ = E\big[S_1(X)|O=o\big] \text{ .}$$

### Problem 3
Let $G_{\epsilon}$ be a path through $G$, the distribution of the censoring time, $C$, given $X$, having score $S_2(C,X)$. This then defines a path $P_{P_XG_{\epsilon}}$ through the observed data distribution, $P_{P_XG}$. Show that the scores generated by these paths are $E[S_2(C, X) | O = o]$.

\vspace{.1in}

$$\frac{d}{d\epsilon}logdP_{P_XG_{\epsilon}}/dP_{P_{X}G}|_{\epsilon=0} = \frac{d}{d\epsilon}logdP_{P_XG_{\epsilon}}|_{\epsilon=0}$$
$$ = \int\frac{S_2(c,x)dP(O=o|X=x)dP(x)d\nu(x)}{dP_{P_XG_{\epsilon}}(o)}$$
$$ = \int S_2(c,x)dP(x|O=o)d\nu(x)$$
$$ = E\big[S_2(C,X)|O=o\big]\text{ .}$$

### Problem 4
This problem involves simulating data under a general Cox model. Letâ€™s make the assumption we have a conditional hazard of death at time, $t$, given by $\lambda(t | X) =  \lambda_0(t)exp(f_{\beta}(X))$ where $X$ is a set of covariates and $f_{\beta}$ is a function indexed by $\beta$, say finite dimensional. Assume the baseline hazard is  $\lambda_0(t) = exp(rt)$ for positive $r$. Given $X$, what is the distribution of death times? Prove your answer.

### Bonus
Assume a CAR model for full data consisting of survival time, censoring time, the continuous baseline covariates and randomly assigned treatment indicator. We have observed data $min(T,C),\Delta$ along with the covariates and treatment indicator. Someome receives a data set of 1000 independent subjects drawn from this model from an RCT and runs a Cox Proportional hazards regression with treatment as the only covariate, showing a significantly negative coefficient. Can you convince this person he may be wrong via simulation? Explain how you set up your simulation and turn in your code to show the results.
